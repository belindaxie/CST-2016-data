AC,Which comes closest to your view on how we should address climate change?,3=Climate change is a serious and pressing problem.

Obtaining energy from a wind farm rather than fossil fuels).",,,,,,,,
WA,"Carbon Neutral Charitable Fund (CNCF) is a non-profit Australian organisation. They use donations to plant native trees on degraded land in order to offset carbon emissions.
